## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student with hands-on experience in Python, Java, web development, and AI deployment. I specialize in building modular, real-time systems using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and JavaScript. My work focuses on clarity, performance, and solving problems that matter.

I thrive on debugging complex workflows, optimizing code structure, and turning ideas into working prototypes.

I build intelligent systems that solve real-world problems—from face mask detection to dynamic web applications.
